# JUDD_LIB

## What this is exactly?
This is a library of single header independet modules, that can create big applications when used together or with others APIs.

## Why that name?
Donald Judd was a freaking cool guy, one of the first minimalistic thinkers. As this API is destined to be the simpler as possible, I decided to homage his work.

## Why C?
Because C is so freaking cool, man.
But really, C is, in my opinion, the cooler language we have.
I already made some projects in C++, js, python and even lua, some were good, some were not, but I always loved and will love C. I am very inspired on sokol, raylib and pico_headers to do this.
Another reasons are for learning, recreation and personal use.
