# Why that name?
Donald Judd was a freaking cool guy, one of the first minimalistic thinkers. As this API is destined to be the simpler as possible, I decided to homage his work.

# Why C?
Because C is so freaking cool, man.
But really, C is, in my opinion, the cooler language we have.
I already made some projects in C++, js, python and even lua, some were good, some were not, but I always loved and will love C. I am very inspired on sokol, raylib and pico_headers to do this.
Another reasons are for learning, recreation and personal use.

# What this is exactly?
Well, I am working in some drafts it's been a time, and now I have some ideas and want to try posting one module by week with a little to tutorial. Sothis is kinda like a book-api. I already made 2 of the modules twice, each time turning them better versions.

# What are the modules?

Now, we just have the judd_core ready, but I'm working on other modules, mainly the `judd_draw`.

The following are planned to the final version:

Module Name | Explanation
-------|--------
judd_core | Opengl context creation and window mangement
judd_draw | Drawing operations on a opengl context
judd_audio | To load and play audio
judd_time | To manage time
judd_ecc | Entity component system
judd_physics | To handle physics

# What platforms are supported?

The focus is on window, linux and emscripten, because I don't have acces to a mac. It's expected that on the 2.0 version of judd_core, mac will be supported.
