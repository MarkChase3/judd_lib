# Why that name?
Donald Judd was a freaking cool guy, one of the first minimalistic thinkers. As this API is destined to be the simpler as possible, I decided to homage his work.

# What this is exactly?
Well, I am working in some drafts it's been a time, and now I have some ideas and want to try posting one module by week with a little to tutorial. SO this is kinda like a book-api. I already made 2 of the modules twice, each time turning them better versions.

# What are the modules?

*TODO*

# Where I can find documentation?

Look at the docs/ folder
