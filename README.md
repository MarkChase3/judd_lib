# Why that name?
Donald Judd was a freaking cool guy, one of the first minimalistic thinkers. As this API is destined to be the simpler as possible, I decided to homage his work.

# What this is exactly?
Well, I am working in some drafts it's been a time, and now I have some ideas and want to try posting one module by week with a little to tutorial. Sothis is kinda like a book-api. I already made 2 of the modules twice, each time turning them better versions.

# What are the modules?

Now, we have just the judd_core.h being built. I am updating it's tutorial on another branch while I make it. I think int 3 days I get it ready.

After that, the following are planned:

Module Name | Explanation
----------------
judd_draw | Drawing operations on a opengl context
judd_audio | To load and play audio
judd_time | To manage time
judd_ecc | Entity component system
judd_physics | To handle physics
